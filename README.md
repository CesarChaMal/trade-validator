Trade validation service
========================

Service which checks trade details 

Service is based on Gradle, Spring 4.3.3 and Spring Boot 1.4.1

Service built from modules which implement separated functionality.
 
 - trade-validator-model : model classes for trade, validation errors 
  
 - trade-validator-api : API interfaces to add new things into validation service
 
 - trade-validator-core : core services for trade validation
  
 - trade-validator-app : REST interface for validating trades
 
 - trade-validators : implementation of trade validation business rules


Each validation rule should implement `TradeValidator` interface and be a spring managed bean, during startup Spring will inject available validators into `ValidationCore`.
REST API controllers calls `ValidationCore` for validate trodes and return results.

Validators from `trade-validators` have pre-defined, hardcoded  settings, can load configurations from spring configurations and also expose JMX managed beans which allow settings change on runtime. 



API endpoints
=============

`/api/validate` - validate single trade, as result is returned trade and list of invalid fields

`/api/validateBulk` - bulk validate of a trade list, as result is returned list of trades and each trade have list of errors

`/api/shutdown` - shutdown endpoint, `GET` request to fetch status, `POST` to shutdown service. Shutdown can be canceled by sending `DELETE` on shutdown API.
Shutdown status is also available through default `/info` endpoint. When shutdown status is set, service no more accept trades for validation.

`/metrics` - fetch  application metrics 

`/swagger-ui.html#/validation-controller` - swagger Rest API documentation
